This is my first Kotlin App. This is a simple app that helps you to calculate your Body Mass Index. Body Mass Index is calculated using wieght and height of the person.

3 Kotlin Concepts used are 

           - Constraint Layout 
                   
           - Functions in Kotlin
           
           - Data Binding
          
This app was built during the #30DaysOfKotlin initiative by Google. I learnt Kotlin using the codelabs provided by Google.
